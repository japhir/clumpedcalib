* functions
This could be turned into a package if it proves useful at some point but I
currently don't have the time.

Ok ok I'll quickly tangle them to R files so the user can install from github.

EDIT: this file is now outdated as I've improved some of the functions in their own files! I've now included all the files here, let's hope that github renders that correctly!

** clumped_calib_boot
[[file:R/clumped_calib_boot.R]]

** filter_outliers
[[file:R/filter_outliers.R]]

** bootstrap_means
[[file:R/bootstrap_means.R]]

** temp_d18Osw_calc
[[file:R/temp_d18Osw_calc.R]]

** our_summary

** d18Osw_calc

** temp_calc

test 'em out in [[file:tests/testthat/test-d18Osw_temp_calculations.R]]

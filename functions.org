* functions
This could be turned into a package if it proves useful at some point but I
currently don't have the time.

Ok ok I'll quickly tangle them to R files so the user can install from github.

EDIT: this file is now outdated as I've improved some of the functions in their own files! I've now included all the files here, let's hope that github renders that correctly!

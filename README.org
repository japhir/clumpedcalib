This document describes how to calculate bootstrapped averages and apply a clumped-isotope specific temperature calibration.

- Calculate bootstrapped York regression from clumped isotope calibration data.
- Calculate bootstrapped sample means for the age, d13C, d18O, and D47.
- Apply the bootstrapped calibration to calculate temperature and d18Osw.

To use this:
1. Install this package ~clumpedcalib~, see [[#installation]].
2. Update the input calibration data [[file:dat/example_calib.csv]]. Make sure the
   column names include ~X~, ~D47~, ~sd_X~, ~sd_D47~
3. Overwrite [[file:functions.org#d18Osw_calc][the function that calculates d18Osw]] to something that you like.
4. Overwrite [[file:functions.org#filter_outliers][filter outliers]] so that it filters out bad measurements for your data.
5. Add your samples at the replicate level and update [[file:clumped-bootstrap-calibration.org#load-sample-data][load sample data]]
6. Walk through [[file:clumped-bootstrap-calibration.org][the example workflow]] step-by-step.
7. Have a look at [[file:functions.org][the functions]] to better understand what's happening.

The bootstrapped calibration idea is based on a Matlab script written by Alvaro Fernandez.

** installation
To install this "package" (it's a quick and dirty draft with ugly function
names, but it should work!):

#+begin_src R
  remotes::install_github("japhir/clumpedcalib")
#+end_src

Or you can look at all the [[file:functions.org][functions]].

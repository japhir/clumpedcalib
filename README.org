* How to calculate bootstrapped averages and apply a clumped-isotope specific temperature calibration.

- Calculate bootstrapped York regression from clumped isotope calibration data.
- Calculate bootstrapped sample means for the age, d13C, d18O, and D47.
- Apply the bootstrapped calibration to calculate temperature and d18Osw.
- Also comes with the classic d18Occ calibrations. See [[file:R/temp_calc.R][temp_calc()]].
- As well as the inverses, for when you have constraints on temperature and wish to calculate d18Osw. See [[file:R/d18Osw_calc.R][d18Osw_calc()]] .

To use this:
1. Install this package ~clumpedcalib~, see [[#installation]].
2. Update the input calibration data [[file:dat/example_calib.csv]]. Make sure the
   column names include ~X~, ~D47~, ~sd_X~, ~sd_D47~.
3. Add your sample data at the replicate level.
4. Check to see if you like [[file:R/d18Osw_calc.R][the function that calculates d18Osw]]. Currently, you can choose from the Kim & O'Neil 1997 calibration, as adjusted by Bemis et al., 1998, or the Marchitto et al., 2014 calibration.
5. Create your own definition of [[file:R/filter_outliers.R][filter outliers]] so that it filters out bad measurements and NA's for your data.
6. Walk through [[file:clumped-bootstrap-calibration.org][the example workflow]] step-by-step.
7. Have a look at [[file:functions.org][the functions]] to better understand what's happening.

The bootstrapped calibration idea is based on a Matlab script written by Alvaro Fernandez.

* installation
To install this development package:

#+begin_src R
  remotes::install_github("japhir/clumpedcalib")
#+end_src

Or you can look at all the [[file:functions.org][functions]] and only copy what you like.
